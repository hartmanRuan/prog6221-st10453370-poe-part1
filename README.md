POE Part 1 of Programming
Usage/Setup----------------------------------------
The project contains a cybersecurity chatbot called franky,due to its ascii art picture, that will answer the question of users. When opening the application, the user is greeted by a voice using a .WAV file. This, combined with the logo on display creates a inviting atmosphere for all users. It continues by asking the user for their name which will be used in all the responses from the chatbot, also to create a comforting atmosphere. The program then displays a final welcoming ascii art and starts to loop through user questions. It ask the user to ask a question, then if the chatbor can find the question in its array, it finds the response using the array counter to find the response in the response array. It either displays an answer or ask the user politely to ask another question. All the possible answers and questions are saved in arrays and are hardcoded by me, Ruan Hartman. This continues until the user types "Bye" and the chatbot responds with a farewell message and closes that program.

PART 2:
When you as the user enters questions, the program can detect basic sentiment by looking for clues in your text that might indicate it. It adresses each one differently. Then the program can now save a topic that you are interested in by entering : Im interested in + topic. It will same this topic until you change it. Also, we added function  of a chatbot to try and sense when a user is experiencing difficulty, it cwill cycle through all of its random responses and give you a different one than what you had previously. The conversation can flow by asking backup questions. There is a random response function added for different responses at times. The program search for key words in the questions and replies accordingly. 

The goal for the program is to enlighten its users of cybersecurity and threats as not many people are aware of the dangers and traps people fall in.

When the code runs, provide the program with your name. This is for personalized responses. Then ask away. Questions like : "How are you", "Who created you", "Emergency", "Logo", "What is your purpose", " Phishing", "Password Safety", "Download Files"... etc. The chatbot will respond with information regarding your question and then ask for another question. This continues until you respond with "Bye". You can also express confusion, anger and interests by simply typing it. For example: "Im interested in phishing". You can also ask the bot to "Tell me more". For more information regarding the topic.
